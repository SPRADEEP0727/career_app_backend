            Please extract and categorize all skills from this resume. Analyze:
            1. Technical skills (programming languages, frameworks, tools)
            2. Professional skills (project management, leadership, etc.)
            3. Domain expertise (industry-specific knowledge)
            4. Soft skills (communication, teamwork, etc.)
            5. Certifications and qualifications

            For each skill, estimate:
            - Proficiency level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert)
            - Years of experience (estimate based on context)
            - Category classification
